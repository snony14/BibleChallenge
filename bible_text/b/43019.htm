And Pilate saith unto them, Behold the man!<BR><DT><A NAME=6>6</a><DD>When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Take ye him, and crucify him: for I find no fault in him.<BR><DT><A NAME=7>7</a><DD>The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.<BR><DT><A NAME=8>8</a><DD>When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid;<BR><DT><A NAME=9>9</a><DD>And went again into the judgment hall, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou?

Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.<BR><DT><A NAME=16>16</a><DD>Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led him away.<BR><DT><A NAME=17>17</a><DD>And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha:<BR><DT><A NAME=18>18</a><DD>Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst.<BR><DT><A NAME=19>19</a><DD>And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the writing was JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS.<BR><DT><A NAME=20>20</a><DD>This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, and Greek, and Latin.<BR><DT><A NAME=21>21</a><DD>Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.<BR><DT><A NAME=22>22</a><DD>Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.<BR><DT><A NAME=23>23</a><DD>Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.<BR><DT><A NAME=24>24</a><DD>They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, <A HREF=19022.htm#18>They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots.</A> These things therefore the soldiers did.
