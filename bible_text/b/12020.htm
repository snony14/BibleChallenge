And he said, Is it not good, if peace and truth be in my days?<BR><DT><A NAME=20>20</a><DD>And the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might, and how he made a pool, and a conduit, and brought water into the city, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?<BR><DT><A NAME=21>21</a><DD>And Hezekiah slept with his fathers: and Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.<BR></DL><CENTER><A HREF=12021.htm>2 Kings 21</A></CENTER><img src=i.gif width=2 height=500><br><center><a href=http://www.truth.info/download/bible.htm>Download Free Bible</a></center></BODY></HTML>
