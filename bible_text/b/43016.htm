And these things I said not unto you at the beginning, because I was with you.<BR><DT><A NAME=5>5</a><DD>But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou?<BR><DT><A NAME=6>6</a><DD>But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart.<BR><DT><A NAME=7>7</a><DD>Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you.<BR><DT><A NAME=8>8</a><DD>And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:<BR><DT><A NAME=9>9</a><DD>Of sin, because they believe not on me;<BR><DT><A NAME=10>10</a><DD>Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more;<BR><DT><A NAME=11>11</a><DD>Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.<BR><DT><A NAME=12>12</a><DD>I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.<BR><DT><A NAME=13>13</a><DD>Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.<BR><DT><A NAME=14>14</a><DD>He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you.<BR><DT><A NAME=15>15</a><DD>All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you.<BR><DT><A NAME=16>16</a><DD>A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father.<BR><DT><A NAME=17>17</a><DD>Then said some of his disciples among themselves, What is this that he saith unto us, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father?<BR><DT><A NAME=18>18</a><DD>They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little while? we cannot tell what he saith.<BR><DT><A NAME=19>19</a><DD>Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto them, Do ye enquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me?<BR><DT><A NAME=20>20</a><DD>Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.<BR><DT><A NAME=21>21</a><DD>A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.<BR><DT><A NAME=22>22</a><DD>And ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you.<BR><DT><A NAME=23>23</a><DD>And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you.<BR><DT><A NAME=24>24</a><DD>Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.<BR><DT><A NAME=25>25</a><DD>These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of the Father.<BR><DT><A NAME=26>26</a><DD>At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you:<BR><DT><A NAME=27>27</a><DD>For the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.<BR><DT><A NAME=28>28</a><DD>I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.<BR><DT><A NAME=29>29</a><DD>His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no proverb.<BR><DT><A NAME=30>30</a><DD>Now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou camest forth from God.<BR><DT><A NAME=31>31</a><DD>Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe?<BR><DT><A NAME=32>32</a><DD>Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.<BR><DT><A NAME=33>33</a><DD>These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.<BR></DL><CENTER><A HREF=43017.htm>John 17</A></CENTER><img src=i.gif width=2 height=500><br><center><a href=http://www.truth.info/download/bible.htm>Download Free Bible</a></center></BODY></HTML>
