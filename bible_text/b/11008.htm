and that they may know that this house, which I have builded, is called by thy name.<BR><DT><A NAME=44>44</a><DD>If thy people go out to battle against their enemy, whithersoever thou shalt send them, and shall pray unto the LORD toward the city which thou hast chosen, and toward the house that I have built for thy name:<BR><DT><A NAME=45>45</a><DD>Then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.<BR><DT><A NAME=46>46</a><DD>If they sin against thee, (for there is no man that sinneth not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captives unto the land of the enemy, far or near;<BR><DT><A NAME=47>47</a><DD>Yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they were carried captives, and repent, and make supplication unto thee in the land of them that carried them captives, saying, We have sinned, and have done perversely, we have committed wickedness;<BR><DT><A NAME=48>48</a><DD>And so return unto thee with all their heart, and with all their soul, in the land of their enemies, which led them away captive, and pray unto thee toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, the city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name:<BR><DT><A NAME=49>49</a><DD>Then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven thy dwelling place, and maintain their cause,<BR><DT><A NAME=50>50</a><DD>And forgive thy people that have sinned against thee, and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against thee, and give them compassion before them who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them:<BR><DT><A NAME=51>51</a><DD>For they be thy people, and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron:<BR><DT><A NAME=52>52</a><DD>That thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant, and unto the supplication of thy people Israel, to hearken unto them in all that they call for unto thee.<BR><DT><A NAME=53>53</a><DD>For thou didst separate them from among all the people of the earth, to be thine inheritance, as thou spakest by the hand of Moses thy servant, when thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt, O LORD God.<BR><DT><A NAME=54>54</a><DD>And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the LORD, he arose from before the altar of the LORD, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to heaven.<BR><DT><A NAME=55>55</a><DD>And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying,<BR><DT><A NAME=56>56</a><DD>Blessed be the LORD, that hath given rest unto his people Israel, according to all that he promised: there hath not failed one word of all his good promise, which he promised by the hand of Moses his servant.<BR><DT><A NAME=57>57</a><DD>The LORD our God be with us, as he was with our fathers: let him not leave us, nor forsake us:<BR><DT><A NAME=58>58</a><DD>That he may incline our hearts unto him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his judgments, which he commanded our fathers.<BR><DT><A NAME=59>59</a><DD>And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication before the LORD, be nigh unto the LORD our God day and night, that he maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of his people Israel at all times, as the matter shall require:<BR><DT><A NAME=60>60</a><DD>That all the people of the earth may know that the LORD is God, and that there is none else.<BR><DT><A NAME=61>61</a><DD>Let your heart therefore be perfect with the LORD our God, to walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this day.<BR><DT><A NAME=62>62</a><DD>And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before the LORD.<BR><DT><A NAME=63>63</a><DD>And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered unto the LORD, two and twenty thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the LORD.<BR><DT><A NAME=64>64</a><DD>The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings: because the brazen altar that was before the LORD was too little to receive the burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings.<BR><DT><A NAME=65>65</a><DD>And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt, before the LORD our God, seven days and seven days, even fourteen days.<BR><DT><A NAME=66>66</a><DD>On the eighth day he sent the people away: and they blessed the king, and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the LORD had done for David his servant, and for Israel his people.<BR></DL><CENTER><A HREF=11009.htm>1 Kings 9</A></CENTER><img src=i.gif width=2 height=500><br><center><a href=http://www.truth.info/download/bible.htm>Download Free Bible</a></center></BODY></HTML>
