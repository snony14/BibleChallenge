And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.<BR><DT><A NAME=3>3</a><DD>As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses.<BR><DT><A NAME=4>4</a><DD>And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good?<BR><DT><A NAME=5>5</a><DD>Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.<BR><DT><A NAME=6>6</a><DD>And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words.<BR><DT><A NAME=7>7</a><DD>And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing:<BR><DT><A NAME=8>8</a><DD>Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold?<BR><DT><A NAME=9>9</a><DD>With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord's bondmen.<BR><DT><A NAME=10>10</a><DD>And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless.<BR><DT><A NAME=11>11</a><DD>Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.<BR><DT><A NAME=12>12</a><DD>And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.<BR><DT><A NAME=13>13</a><DD>Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city.<BR><DT><A NAME=14>14</a><DD>And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; for he was yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.<BR><DT><A NAME=15>15</a><DD>And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?<BR><DT><A NAME=16>16</a><DD>And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord's servants, both we, and he also with whom the cup is found.<BR><DT><A NAME=17>17</a><DD>And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, get you up in peace unto your father.<BR><DT><A NAME=18>18</a><DD>Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou art even as Pharaoh.<BR><DT><A NAME=19>19</a><DD>My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?<BR><DT><A NAME=20>20</a><DD>And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.<BR><DT><A NAME=21>21</a><DD>And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him.<BR><DT><A NAME=22>22</a><DD>And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die.<BR><DT><A NAME=23>23</a><DD>And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.<BR><DT><A NAME=24>24</a><DD>And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.<BR><DT><A NAME=25>25</a><DD>And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food.<BR><DT><A NAME=26>26</a><DD>And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's face, except our youngest brother be with us.<BR><DT><A NAME=27>27</a><DD>And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two sons:<BR><DT><A NAME=28>28</a><DD>And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since:<BR><DT><A NAME=29>29</a><DD>And if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.<BR><DT><A NAME=30>30</a><DD>Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life;<BR><DT><A NAME=31>31</a><DD>It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with us, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.<BR><DT><A NAME=32>32</a><DD>For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever.<BR><DT><A NAME=33>33</a><DD>Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.<BR><DT><A NAME=34>34</a><DD>For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father.<BR></DL><CENTER><A HREF=01045.htm>Genesis 45</A></CENTER><img src=i.gif width=2 height=500><br><center><a href=http://www.truth.info/download/bible.htm>Download Free Bible</a></center></BODY></HTML>
