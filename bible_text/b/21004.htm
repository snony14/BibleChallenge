This is also vanity and vexation of spirit.<BR><DT><A NAME=5>5</a><DD>The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.<BR><DT><A NAME=6>6</a><DD>Better is an handful with quietness, than both the hands full with travail and vexation of spirit.<BR><DT><A NAME=7>7</a><DD>Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun.<BR><DT><A NAME=8>8</a><DD>There is one alone, and there is not a second; yea, he hath neither child nor brother: yet is there no end of all his labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither saith he, For whom do I labour, and bereave my soul of good? This is also vanity, yea, it is a sore travail.<BR><DT><A NAME=9>9</a><DD>Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour.<BR><DT><A NAME=10>10</a><DD>For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to help him up.<BR><DT><A NAME=11>11</a><DD>Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm alone?<BR><DT><A NAME=12>12</a><DD>And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.<BR><DT><A NAME=13>13</a><DD>Better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king, who will no more be admonished.<BR><DT><A NAME=14>14</a><DD>For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also he that is born in his kingdom becometh poor.<BR><DT><A NAME=15>15</a><DD>I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the second child that shall stand up in his stead.<BR><DT><A NAME=16>16</a><DD>There is no end of all the people, even of all that have been before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and vexation of spirit.<BR></DL><CENTER><A HREF=21005.htm>Ecclesiastes 5</A></CENTER><img src=i.gif width=2 height=500><br><center><a href=http://www.truth.info/download/bible.htm>Download Free Bible</a></center></BODY></HTML>
