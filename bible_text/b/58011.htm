and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.<BR><DT><A NAME=6>6</a><DD>But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.<BR><DT><A NAME=7>7</a><DD>By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house;
