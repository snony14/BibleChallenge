Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead.<BR><DT><A NAME=26>26</a><DD>And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives taken with the sword?<BR><DT><A NAME=27>27</a><DD>Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?<BR><DT><A NAME=28>28</a><DD>And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? thou hast now done foolishly in so doing.<BR><DT><A NAME=29>29</a><DD>It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.<BR><DT><A NAME=30>30</a><DD>And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore longedst after thy father's house, yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods?<BR><DT><A NAME=31>31</a><DD>And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me.<BR><DT><A NAME=32>32</a><DD>With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.<BR><DT><A NAME=33>33</a><DD>And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the two maidservants' tents; but he found them not. Then went he out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.<BR><DT><A NAME=34>34</a><DD>Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but found them not.<BR><DT><A NAME=35>35</a><DD>And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon me. And he searched but found not the images.<BR><DT><A NAME=36>36</a><DD>And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me?<BR><DT><A NAME=37>37</a><DD>Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both.<BR><DT><A NAME=38>38</a><DD>This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten.<BR><DT><A NAME=39>39</a><DD>That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day, or stolen by night.<BR><DT><A NAME=40>40</a><DD>Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes.<BR><DT><A NAME=41>41</a><DD>Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle: and thou hast changed my wages ten times.<BR><DT><A NAME=42>42</a><DD>Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labor of my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight.<BR><DT><A NAME=43>43</a><DD>And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my daughters, and these children are my children, and these cattle are my cattle, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their children which they have born?<BR><DT><A NAME=44>44</a><DD>Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee.<BR><DT><A NAME=45>45</a><DD>And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.<BR><DT><A NAME=46>46</a><DD>And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the heap.<BR><DT><A NAME=47>47</a><DD>And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed.<BR><DT><A NAME=48>48</a><DD>And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed;<BR><DT><A NAME=49>49</a><DD>And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another.<BR><DT><A NAME=50>50</a><DD>If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness betwixt me and thee.<BR><DT><A NAME=51>51</a><DD>And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee:<BR><DT><A NAME=52>52</a><DD>This heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm.<BR><DT><A NAME=53>53</a><DD>The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his father Isaac.<BR><DT><A NAME=54>54</a><DD>Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mount.<BR><DT><A NAME=55>55</a><DD>And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto his place.<BR></DL><CENTER><A HREF=01032.htm>Genesis 32</A></CENTER><img src=i.gif width=2 height=500><br><center><a href=http://www.truth.info/download/bible.htm>Download Free Bible</a></center></BODY></HTML>
