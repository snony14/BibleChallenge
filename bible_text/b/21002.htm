Then I said in my heart, that this also is vanity.<BR><DT><A NAME=16>16</a><DD>For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And how dieth the wise man? as the fool.<BR><DT><A NAME=17>17</a><DD>Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun is grievous unto me: for all is vanity and vexation of spirit.<BR><DT><A NAME=18>18</a><DD>Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun: because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me.<BR><DT><A NAME=19>19</a><DD>And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun. This is also vanity.<BR><DT><A NAME=20>20</a><DD>Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which I took under the sun.<BR><DT><A NAME=21>21</a><DD>For there is a man whose labour is in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil.<BR><DT><A NAME=22>22</a><DD>For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun?<BR><DT><A NAME=23>23</a><DD>For all his days are sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity.<BR><DT><A NAME=24>24</a><DD>There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour. This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God.<BR><DT><A NAME=25>25</a><DD>For who can eat, or who else can hasten hereunto, more than I?<BR><DT><A NAME=26>26</a><DD>For God giveth to a man that is good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that is good before God. This also is vanity and vexation of spirit.<BR></DL><CENTER><A HREF=21003.htm>Ecclesiastes 3</A></CENTER><img src=i.gif width=2 height=500><br><center><a href=http://www.truth.info/download/bible.htm>Download Free Bible</a></center></BODY></HTML>
