who received us, and lodged us three days courteously.<BR><DT><A NAME=8>8</a><DD>And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.<BR><DT><A NAME=9>9</a><DD>So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed:<BR><DT><A NAME=10>10</a><DD>Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they laded us with such things as were necessary.<BR><DT><A NAME=11>11</a><DD>And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.<BR><DT><A NAME=12>12</a><DD>And landing at Syracuse, we tarried there three days.<BR><DT><A NAME=13>13</a><DD>And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli:<BR><DT><A NAME=14>14</a><DD>Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome.<BR><DT><A NAME=15>15</a><DD>And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.<BR><DT><A NAME=16>16</a><DD>And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.<BR><DT><A NAME=17>17</a><DD>And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men and brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.<BR><DT><A NAME=18>18</a><DD>Who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because there was no cause of death in me.<BR><DT><A NAME=19>19</a><DD>But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of.<BR><DT><A NAME=20>20</a><DD>For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.<BR><DT><A NAME=21>21</a><DD>And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee.<BR><DT><A NAME=22>22</a><DD>But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.<BR><DT><A NAME=23>23</a><DD>And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and out of the prophets, from morning till evening.<BR><DT><A NAME=24>24</a><DD>And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not.<BR><DT><A NAME=25>25</a><DD>And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers,<BR><DT><A NAME=26>26</a><DD>Saying, <A HREF=23006.htm#9>Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand;
