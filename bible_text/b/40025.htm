go ye out to meet him.<BR><DT><A NAME=7>7</a><DD>Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.<BR><DT><A NAME=8>8</a><DD>And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.<BR><DT><A NAME=9>9</a><DD>But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.<BR><DT><A NAME=10>10</a><DD>And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.<BR><DT><A NAME=11>11</a><DD>Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.<BR><DT><A NAME=12>12</a><DD>But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.<BR><DT><A NAME=13>13</a><DD>Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.<BR><DT><A NAME=14>14</a><DD>For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.<BR><DT><A NAME=15>15</a><DD>And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey.<BR><DT><A NAME=16>16</a><DD>Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made them other five talents.<BR><DT><A NAME=17>17</a><DD>And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two.<BR><DT><A NAME=18>18</a><DD>But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money.<BR><DT><A NAME=19>19</a><DD>After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them.<BR><DT><A NAME=20>20</a><DD>And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.<BR><DT><A NAME=21>21</a><DD>His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.<BR><DT><A NAME=22>22</a><DD>He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them.<BR><DT><A NAME=23>23</a><DD>His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.<BR><DT><A NAME=24>24</a><DD>Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:<BR><DT><A NAME=25>25</a><DD>And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, there thou hast that is thine.<BR><DT><A NAME=26>26</a><DD>His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed:<BR><DT><A NAME=27>27</a><DD>Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.<BR><DT><A NAME=28>28</a><DD>Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents.<BR><DT><A NAME=29>29</a><DD>For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.<BR><DT><A NAME=30>30</a><DD>And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.<BR><DT><A NAME=31>31</a><DD>When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:<BR><DT><A NAME=32>32</a><DD>And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats:<BR><DT><A NAME=33>33</a><DD>And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.<BR><DT><A NAME=34>34</a><DD>Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:<BR><DT><A NAME=35>35</a><DD>For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:<BR><DT><A NAME=36>36</a><DD>Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.<BR><DT><A NAME=37>37</a><DD>Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?<BR><DT><A NAME=38>38</a><DD>When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?<BR><DT><A NAME=39>39</a><DD>Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?<BR><DT><A NAME=40>40</a><DD>And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.<BR><DT><A NAME=41>41</a><DD>Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:<BR><DT><A NAME=42>42</a><DD>For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink:<BR><DT><A NAME=43>43</a><DD>I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.<BR><DT><A NAME=44>44</a><DD>Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?<BR><DT><A NAME=45>45</a><DD>Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me.<BR><DT><A NAME=46>46</a><DD>And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.<BR></DL><CENTER><A HREF=40026.htm>Matthew 26</A></CENTER><img src=i.gif width=2 height=500><br><center><a href=http://www.truth.info/download/bible.htm>Download Free Bible</a></center></BODY></HTML>
