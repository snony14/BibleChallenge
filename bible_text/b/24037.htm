But he hearkened not to him: so Irijah took Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes.<BR><DT><A NAME=15>15</a><DD>Wherefore the princes were wroth with Jeremiah, and smote him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe: for they had made that the prison.<BR><DT><A NAME=16>16</a><DD>When Jeremiah was entered into the dungeon, and into the cabins, and Jeremiah had remained there many days;<BR><DT><A NAME=17>17</a><DD>Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took him out: and the king asked him secretly in his house, and said, Is there any word from the LORD? And Jeremiah said, There is: for, said he, thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.<BR><DT><A NAME=18>18</a><DD>Moreover Jeremiah said unto king Zedekiah, What have I offended against thee, or against thy servants, or against this people, that ye have put me in prison?<BR><DT><A NAME=19>19</a><DD>Where are now your prophets which prophesied unto you, saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land?<BR><DT><A NAME=20>20</a><DD>Therefore hear now, I pray thee, O my lord the king: let my supplication, I pray thee, be accepted before thee; that thou cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.<BR><DT><A NAME=21>21</a><DD>Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah into the court of the prison, and that they should give him daily a piece of bread out of the bakers' street, until all the bread in the city were spent. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.<BR></DL><CENTER><A HREF=24038.htm>Jeremiah 38</A></CENTER><img src=i.gif width=2 height=500><br><center><a href=http://www.truth.info/download/bible.htm>Download Free Bible</a></center></BODY></HTML>
