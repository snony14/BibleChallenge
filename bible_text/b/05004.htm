only ye heard a voice.<BR><DT><A NAME=13>13</a><DD>And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone.<BR><DT><A NAME=14>14</a><DD>And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it.<BR><DT><A NAME=15>15</a><DD>Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day that the LORD spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire:<BR><DT><A NAME=16>16</a><DD>Lest ye corrupt yourselves, and make you a graven image, the similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or female,<BR><DT><A NAME=17>17</a><DD>The likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air,<BR><DT><A NAME=18>18</a><DD>The likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth:<BR><DT><A NAME=19>19</a><DD>And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the host of heaven, shouldest be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the LORD thy God hath divided unto all nations under the whole heaven.<BR><DT><A NAME=20>20</a><DD>But the LORD hath taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron furnace, even out of Egypt, to be unto him a people of inheritance, as ye are this day.<BR><DT><A NAME=21>21</a><DD>Furthermore the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, and sware that I should not go over Jordan, and that I should not go in unto that good land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance:<BR><DT><A NAME=22>22</a><DD>But I must die in this land, I must not go over Jordan: but ye shall go over, and possess that good land.<BR><DT><A NAME=23>23</a><DD>Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the LORD your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, which the LORD thy God hath forbidden thee.<BR><DT><A NAME=24>24</a><DD>For the LORD thy God is a consuming fire, even a jealous God.<BR><DT><A NAME=25>25</a><DD>When thou shalt beget children, and children's children, and ye shall have remained long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves, and make a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, and shall do evil in the sight of the LORD thy God, to provoke him to anger:<BR><DT><A NAME=26>26</a><DD>I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over Jordan to possess it;
