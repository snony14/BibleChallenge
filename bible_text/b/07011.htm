And in like manner they sent unto the king of Moab: but he would not consent: and Israel abode in Kadesh.<BR><DT><A NAME=18>18</a><DD>Then they went along through the wilderness, and compassed the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, but came not within the border of Moab: for Arnon was the border of Moab.<BR><DT><A NAME=19>19</a><DD>And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said unto him, Let us pass, we pray thee, through thy land into my place.<BR><DT><A NAME=20>20</a><DD>But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his coast: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and pitched in Jahaz, and fought against Israel.<BR><DT><A NAME=21>21</a><DD>And the LORD God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they smote them: so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country.<BR><DT><A NAME=22>22</a><DD>And they possessed all the coasts of the Amorites, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and from the wilderness even unto Jordan.<BR><DT><A NAME=23>23</a><DD>So now the LORD God of Israel hath dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel, and shouldest thou possess it?<BR><DT><A NAME=24>24</a><DD>Wilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess? So whomsoever the LORD our God shall drive out from before us, them will we possess.<BR><DT><A NAME=25>25</a><DD>And now art thou any thing better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them,<BR><DT><A NAME=26>26</a><DD>While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and her towns, and in Aroer and her towns, and in all the cities that be along by the coasts of Arnon, three hundred years? why therefore did ye not recover them within that time?<BR><DT><A NAME=27>27</a><DD>Wherefore I have not sinned against thee, but thou doest me wrong to war against me: the LORD the Judge be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon.<BR><DT><A NAME=28>28</a><DD>Howbeit the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not unto the words of Jephthah which he sent him.<BR><DT><A NAME=29>29</a><DD>Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead, and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over unto the children of Ammon.<BR><DT><A NAME=30>30</a><DD>And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou shalt without fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine hands,<BR><DT><A NAME=31>31</a><DD>Then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the LORD's, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering.<BR><DT><A NAME=32>32</a><DD>So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight against them; and the LORD delivered them into his hands.<BR><DT><A NAME=33>33</a><DD>And he smote them from Aroer, even till thou come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and unto the plain of the vineyards, with a very great slaughter. Thus the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel.<BR><DT><A NAME=34>34</a><DD>And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter.<BR><DT><A NAME=35>35</a><DD>And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thou art one of them that trouble me: for I have opened my mouth unto the LORD, and I cannot go back.<BR><DT><A NAME=36>36</a><DD>And she said unto him, My father, if thou hast opened thy mouth unto the LORD, do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth; forasmuch as the LORD hath taken vengeance for thee of thine enemies, even of the children of Ammon.<BR><DT><A NAME=37>37</a><DD>And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me: let me alone two months, that I may go up and down upon the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my fellows.<BR><DT><A NAME=38>38</a><DD>And he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months: and she went with her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains.<BR><DT><A NAME=39>39</a><DD>And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned unto her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed: and she knew no man. And it was a custom in Israel,<BR><DT><A NAME=40>40</a><DD>That the daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year.<BR></DL><CENTER><A HREF=07012.htm>Judges 12</A></CENTER><img src=i.gif width=2 height=500><br><center><a href=http://www.truth.info/download/bible.htm>Download Free Bible</a></center></BODY></HTML>
