These things teach and exhort.<BR><DT><A NAME=3>3</a><DD>If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness;<BR><DT><A NAME=4>4</a><DD>He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings,<BR><DT><A NAME=5>5</a><DD>Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw thyself.<BR><DT><A NAME=6>6</a><DD>But godliness with contentment is great gain.<BR><DT><A NAME=7>7</a><DD>For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out.<BR><DT><A NAME=8>8</a><DD>And having food and raiment let us be therewith content.<BR><DT><A NAME=9>9</a><DD>But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.<BR><DT><A NAME=10>10</a><DD>For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.<BR><DT><A NAME=11>11</a><DD>But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.<BR><DT><A NAME=12>12</a><DD>Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses.<BR><DT><A NAME=13>13</a><DD>I give thee charge in the sight of God, who quickeneth all things, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession;<BR><DT><A NAME=14>14</a><DD>That thou keep this commandment without spot, unrebukable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ:<BR><DT><A NAME=15>15</a><DD>Which in his times he shall shew, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;<BR><DT><A NAME=16>16</a><DD>Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honour and power everlasting.
