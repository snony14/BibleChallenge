If thou do these things, shew thyself to the world.<BR><DT><A NAME=5>5</a><DD>For neither did his brethren believe in him.<BR><DT><A NAME=6>6</a><DD>Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready.<BR><DT><A NAME=7>7</a><DD>The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil.<BR><DT><A NAME=8>8</a><DD>Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast: for my time is not yet full come.<BR><DT><A NAME=9>9</a><DD>When he had said these words unto them, he abode still in Galilee.<BR><DT><A NAME=10>10</a><DD>But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.<BR><DT><A NAME=11>11</a><DD>Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?<BR><DT><A NAME=12>12</a><DD>And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people.<BR><DT><A NAME=13>13</a><DD>Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.<BR><DT><A NAME=14>14</a><DD>Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.<BR><DT><A NAME=15>15</a><DD>And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?<BR><DT><A NAME=16>16</a><DD>Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.<BR><DT><A NAME=17>17</a><DD>If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.<BR><DT><A NAME=18>18</a><DD>He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.<BR><DT><A NAME=19>19</a><DD>Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill me?<BR><DT><A NAME=20>20</a><DD>The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee?<BR><DT><A NAME=21>21</a><DD>Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel.<BR><DT><A NAME=22>22</a><DD>Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man.<BR><DT><A NAME=23>23</a><DD>If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?<BR><DT><A NAME=24>24</a><DD>Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.<BR><DT><A NAME=25>25</a><DD>Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?<BR><DT><A NAME=26>26</a><DD>But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?<BR><DT><A NAME=27>27</a><DD>Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.<BR><DT><A NAME=28>28</a><DD>Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.<BR><DT><A NAME=29>29</a><DD>But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me.<BR><DT><A NAME=30>30</a><DD>Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.<BR><DT><A NAME=31>31</a><DD>And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done?<BR><DT><A NAME=32>32</a><DD>The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him.<BR><DT><A NAME=33>33</a><DD>Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go unto him that sent me.<BR><DT><A NAME=34>34</a><DD>Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come.<BR><DT><A NAME=35>35</a><DD>Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?<BR><DT><A NAME=36>36</a><DD>What manner of saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come?<BR><DT><A NAME=37>37</a><DD>In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.<BR><DT><A NAME=38>38</a><DD>He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.<BR><DT><A NAME=39>39</a><DD>(But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)<BR><DT><A NAME=40>40</a><DD>Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet.<BR><DT><A NAME=41>41</a><DD>Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee?<BR><DT><A NAME=42>42</a><DD>Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?<BR><DT><A NAME=43>43</a><DD>So there was a division among the people because of him.<BR><DT><A NAME=44>44</a><DD>And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.<BR><DT><A NAME=45>45</a><DD>Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?<BR><DT><A NAME=46>46</a><DD>The officers answered, Never man spake like this man.<BR><DT><A NAME=47>47</a><DD>Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived?<BR><DT><A NAME=48>48</a><DD>Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?<BR><DT><A NAME=49>49</a><DD>But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed.<BR><DT><A NAME=50>50</a><DD>Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,)<BR><DT><A NAME=51>51</a><DD>Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth?<BR><DT><A NAME=52>52</a><DD>They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.<BR><DT><A NAME=53>53</a><DD>And every man went unto his own house.<BR></DL><CENTER><A HREF=43008.htm>John 8</A></CENTER><img src=i.gif width=2 height=500><br><center><a href=http://www.truth.info/download/bible.htm>Download Free Bible</a></center></BODY></HTML>
