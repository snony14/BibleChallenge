And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; there was no open vision.<BR><DT><A NAME=2>2</a><DD>And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, that he could not see;<BR><DT><A NAME=3>3</a><DD>And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep;<BR><DT><A NAME=4>4</a><DD>That the LORD called Samuel: and he answered, Here am I.<BR><DT><A NAME=5>5</a><DD>And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.<BR><DT><A NAME=6>6</a><DD>And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.<BR><DT><A NAME=7>7</a><DD>Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed unto him.<BR><DT><A NAME=8>8</a><DD>And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child.<BR><DT><A NAME=9>9</a><DD>Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.<BR><DT><A NAME=10>10</a><DD>And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth.<BR><DT><A NAME=11>11</a><DD>And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.<BR><DT><A NAME=12>12</a><DD>In that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end.<BR><DT><A NAME=13>13</a><DD>For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.<BR><DT><A NAME=14>14</a><DD>And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever.<BR><DT><A NAME=15>15</a><DD>And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD.
