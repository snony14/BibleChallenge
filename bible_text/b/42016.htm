And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty.<BR><DT><A NAME=7>7</a><DD>Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and write fourscore.<BR><DT><A NAME=8>8</a><DD>And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.<BR><DT><A NAME=9>9</a><DD>And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.<BR><DT><A NAME=10>10</a><DD>He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.<BR><DT><A NAME=11>11</a><DD>If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?<BR><DT><A NAME=12>12</a><DD>And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who shall give you that which is your own?<BR><DT><A NAME=13>13</a><DD>No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.<BR><DT><A NAME=14>14</a><DD>And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him.<BR><DT><A NAME=15>15</a><DD>And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.<BR><DT><A NAME=16>16</a><DD>The law and the prophets were until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it.<BR><DT><A NAME=17>17</a><DD>And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail.<BR><DT><A NAME=18>18</a><DD>Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband committeth adultery.<BR><DT><A NAME=19>19</a><DD>There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:<BR><DT><A NAME=20>20</a><DD>And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores,<BR><DT><A NAME=21>21</a><DD>And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.<BR><DT><A NAME=22>22</a><DD>And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;<BR><DT><A NAME=23>23</a><DD>And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.<BR><DT><A NAME=24>24</a><DD>And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.<BR><DT><A NAME=25>25</a><DD>But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.<BR><DT><A NAME=26>26</a><DD>And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence.<BR><DT><A NAME=27>27</a><DD>Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house:<BR><DT><A NAME=28>28</a><DD>For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.<BR><DT><A NAME=29>29</a><DD>Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.<BR><DT><A NAME=30>30</a><DD>And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.<BR><DT><A NAME=31>31</a><DD>And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.<BR></DL><CENTER><A HREF=42017.htm>Luke 17</A></CENTER><img src=i.gif width=2 height=500><br><center><a href=http://www.truth.info/download/bible.htm>Download Free Bible</a></center></BODY></HTML>
