Then David departed, and came into the forest of Hareth.<BR><DT><A NAME=6>6</a><DD>When Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that were with him, (now Saul abode in Gibeah under a tree in Ramah, having his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him;)<BR><DT><A NAME=7>7</a><DD>Then Saul said unto his servants that stood about him, Hear now, ye Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, and make you all captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds;<BR><DT><A NAME=8>8</a><DD>That all of you have conspired against me, and there is none that showeth me that my son hath made a league with the son of Jesse, and there is none of you that is sorry for me, or showeth unto me that my son hath stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?<BR><DT><A NAME=9>9</a><DD>Then answered Doeg the Edomite, which was set over the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.<BR><DT><A NAME=10>10</a><DD>And he inquired of the LORD for him, and gave him victuals, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.<BR><DT><A NAME=11>11</a><DD>Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests that were in Nob: and they came all of them to the king.<BR><DT><A NAME=12>12</a><DD>And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Ahitub. And he answered, Here I am, my lord.<BR><DT><A NAME=13>13</a><DD>And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a sword, and hast inquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?<BR><DT><A NAME=14>14</a><DD>Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who is so faithful among all thy servants as David, which is the king's son in law, and goeth at thy bidding, and is honorable in thine house?<BR><DT><A NAME=15>15</a><DD>Did I then begin to inquire of God for him? be it far from me: let not the king impute any thing unto his servant, nor to all the house of my father: for thy servant knew nothing of all this, less or more.<BR><DT><A NAME=16>16</a><DD>And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and all thy father's house.<BR><DT><A NAME=17>17</a><DD>And the king said unto the footmen that stood about him, Turn, and slay the priests of the LORD: because their hand also is with David, and because they knew when he fled, and did not show it to me.
