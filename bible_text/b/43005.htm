He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him.<BR><DT><A NAME=24>24</a><DD>Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.<BR><DT><A NAME=25>25</a><DD>Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.<BR><DT><A NAME=26>26</a><DD>For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;<BR><DT><A NAME=27>27</a><DD>And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.<BR><DT><A NAME=28>28</a><DD>Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,<BR><DT><A NAME=29>29</a><DD>And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.<BR><DT><A NAME=30>30</a><DD>I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.<BR><DT><A NAME=31>31</a><DD>If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.<BR><DT><A NAME=32>32</a><DD>There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.<BR><DT><A NAME=33>33</a><DD>Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth.<BR><DT><A NAME=34>34</a><DD>But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye might be saved.<BR><DT><A NAME=35>35</a><DD>He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.<BR><DT><A NAME=36>36</a><DD>But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.<BR><DT><A NAME=37>37</a><DD>And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.<BR><DT><A NAME=38>38</a><DD>And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not.<BR><DT><A NAME=39>39</a><DD>Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.<BR><DT><A NAME=40>40</a><DD>And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.<BR><DT><A NAME=41>41</a><DD>I receive not honour from men.<BR><DT><A NAME=42>42</a><DD>But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.<BR><DT><A NAME=43>43</a><DD>I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.<BR><DT><A NAME=44>44</a><DD>How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that cometh from God only?<BR><DT><A NAME=45>45</a><DD>Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye trust.<BR><DT><A NAME=46>46</a><DD>For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me; for he wrote of me.<BR><DT><A NAME=47>47</a><DD>But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?<BR></DL><CENTER><A HREF=43006.htm>John 6</A></CENTER><img src=i.gif width=2 height=500><br><center><a href=http://www.truth.info/download/bible.htm>Download Free Bible</a></center></BODY></HTML>
