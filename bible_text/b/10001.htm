And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.<BR><DT><A NAME=4>4</a><DD>And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.<BR><DT><A NAME=5>5</a><DD>And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?<BR><DT><A NAME=6>6</a><DD>And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.<BR><DT><A NAME=7>7</a><DD>And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here am I.<BR><DT><A NAME=8>8</a><DD>And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite.<BR><DT><A NAME=9>9</a><DD>He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life is yet whole in me.<BR><DT><A NAME=10>10</a><DD>So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord.<BR><DT><A NAME=11>11</a><DD>Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him:<BR><DT><A NAME=12>12</a><DD>And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.<BR><DT><A NAME=13>13</a><DD>And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou? And he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.<BR><DT><A NAME=14>14</a><DD>And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the LORD's anointed?<BR><DT><A NAME=15>15</a><DD>And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.<BR><DT><A NAME=16>16</a><DD>And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the LORD's anointed.<BR><DT><A NAME=17>17</a><DD>And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:<BR><DT><A NAME=18>18</a><DD>(Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.)<BR><DT><A NAME=19>19</a><DD>The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen!<BR><DT><A NAME=20>20</a><DD>Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.<BR><DT><A NAME=21>21</a><DD>Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oil.<BR><DT><A NAME=22>22</a><DD>From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.<BR><DT><A NAME=23>23</a><DD>Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.<BR><DT><A NAME=24>24</a><DD>Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel.<BR><DT><A NAME=25>25</a><DD>How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, thou wast slain in thine high places.<BR><DT><A NAME=26>26</a><DD>I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.<BR><DT><A NAME=27>27</a><DD>How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!<BR></DL><CENTER><A HREF=10002.htm>2 Samuel 2</A></CENTER><img src=i.gif width=2 height=500><br><center><a href=http://www.truth.info/download/bible.htm>Download Free Bible</a></center></BODY></HTML>
