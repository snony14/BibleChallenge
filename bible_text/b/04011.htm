and wherefore have I not found favor in thy sight, that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me?<BR><DT><A NAME=12>12</a><DD>Have I conceived all this people? have I begotten them, that thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing father beareth the sucking child, unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers?<BR><DT><A NAME=13>13</a><DD>Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people?
