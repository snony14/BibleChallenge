But she returned not. And her treacherous sister Judah saw it.<BR><DT><A NAME=8>8</a><DD>And I saw, when for all the causes whereby backsliding Israel committed adultery I had put her away, and given her a bill of divorce; yet her treacherous sister Judah feared not, but went and played the harlot also.<BR><DT><A NAME=9>9</a><DD>And it came to pass through the lightness of her whoredom, that she defiled the land, and committed adultery with stones and with stocks.<BR><DT><A NAME=10>10</a><DD>And yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah hath not turned unto me with her whole heart, but feignedly, saith the LORD.<BR><DT><A NAME=11>11</a><DD>And the LORD said unto me, The backsliding Israel hath justified herself more than treacherous Judah.<BR><DT><A NAME=12>12</a><DD>Go and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, Return, thou backsliding Israel, saith the LORD; and I will not cause mine anger to fall upon you: for I am merciful, saith the LORD, and I will not keep anger for ever.<BR><DT><A NAME=13>13</a><DD>Only acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou hast transgressed against the LORD thy God, and hast scattered thy ways to the strangers under every green tree, and ye have not obeyed my voice, saith the LORD.<BR><DT><A NAME=14>14</a><DD>Turn, O backsliding children, saith the LORD; for I am married unto you: and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you to Zion:<BR><DT><A NAME=15>15</a><DD>And I will give you pastors according to mine heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.<BR><DT><A NAME=16>16</a><DD>And it shall come to pass, when ye be multiplied and increased in the land, in those days, saith the LORD, they shall say no more, The ark of the covenant of the LORD: neither shall it come to mind: neither shall they remember it; neither shall they visit it; neither shall that be done any more.<BR><DT><A NAME=17>17</a><DD>At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the LORD; and all the nations shall be gathered unto it, to the name of the LORD, to Jerusalem: neither shall they walk any more after the imagination of their evil heart.<BR><DT><A NAME=18>18</a><DD>In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel, and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that I have given for an inheritance unto your fathers.<BR><DT><A NAME=19>19</a><DD>But I said, How shall I put thee among the children, and give thee a pleasant land, a goodly heritage of the hosts of nations? and I said, Thou shalt call me, My father; and shalt not turn away from me.<BR><DT><A NAME=20>20</a><DD>Surely as a wife treacherously departeth from her husband, so have ye dealt treacherously with me, O house of Israel, saith the LORD.<BR><DT><A NAME=21>21</a><DD>A voice was heard upon the high places, weeping and supplications of the children of Israel: for they have perverted their way, and they have forgotten the LORD their God.<BR><DT><A NAME=22>22</a><DD>Return, ye backsliding children, and I will heal your backslidings.
