He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing.<BR><DT><A NAME=8>8</a><DD>The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?<BR><DT><A NAME=9>9</a><DD>Some said, This is he: others said, He is like him: but he said, I am he.<BR><DT><A NAME=10>10</a><DD>Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened?<BR><DT><A NAME=11>11</a><DD>He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight.<BR><DT><A NAME=12>12</a><DD>Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not.<BR><DT><A NAME=13>13</a><DD>They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.<BR><DT><A NAME=14>14</a><DD>And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.<BR><DT><A NAME=15>15</a><DD>Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see.<BR><DT><A NAME=16>16</a><DD>Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.<BR><DT><A NAME=17>17</a><DD>They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet.<BR><DT><A NAME=18>18</a><DD>But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight.<BR><DT><A NAME=19>19</a><DD>And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see?<BR><DT><A NAME=20>20</a><DD>His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:<BR><DT><A NAME=21>21</a><DD>But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.<BR><DT><A NAME=22>22</a><DD>These words spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.<BR><DT><A NAME=23>23</a><DD>Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.<BR><DT><A NAME=24>24</a><DD>Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.<BR><DT><A NAME=25>25</a><DD>He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.<BR><DT><A NAME=26>26</a><DD>Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?<BR><DT><A NAME=27>27</a><DD>He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear it again? will ye also be his disciples?<BR><DT><A NAME=28>28</a><DD>Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses' disciples.<BR><DT><A NAME=29>29</a><DD>We know that God spake unto Moses: as for this fellow, we know not from whence he is.<BR><DT><A NAME=30>30</a><DD>The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine eyes.<BR><DT><A NAME=31>31</a><DD>Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth.<BR><DT><A NAME=32>32</a><DD>Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind.<BR><DT><A NAME=33>33</a><DD>If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.<BR><DT><A NAME=34>34</a><DD>They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.<BR><DT><A NAME=35>35</a><DD>Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?<BR><DT><A NAME=36>36</a><DD>He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?<BR><DT><A NAME=37>37</a><DD>And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.<BR><DT><A NAME=38>38</a><DD>And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.<BR><DT><A NAME=39>39</a><DD>And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.<BR><DT><A NAME=40>40</a><DD>And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also?<BR><DT><A NAME=41>41</a><DD>Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth.<BR></DL><CENTER><A HREF=43010.htm>John 10</A></CENTER><img src=i.gif width=2 height=500><br><center><a href=http://www.truth.info/download/bible.htm>Download Free Bible</a></center></BODY></HTML>
