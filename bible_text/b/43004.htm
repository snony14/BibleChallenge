Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour.<BR><DT><A NAME=7>7</a><DD>There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink.<BR><DT><A NAME=8>8</a><DD>(For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)<BR><DT><A NAME=9>9</a><DD>Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.<BR><DT><A NAME=10>10</a><DD>Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.<BR><DT><A NAME=11>11</a><DD>The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?<BR><DT><A NAME=12>12</a><DD>Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?<BR><DT><A NAME=13>13</a><DD>Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:<BR><DT><A NAME=14>14</a><DD>But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.<BR><DT><A NAME=15>15</a><DD>The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.<BR><DT><A NAME=16>16</a><DD>Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.<BR><DT><A NAME=17>17</a><DD>The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband:<BR><DT><A NAME=18>18</a><DD>For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.<BR><DT><A NAME=19>19</a><DD>The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.<BR><DT><A NAME=20>20</a><DD>Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.<BR><DT><A NAME=21>21</a><DD>Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.<BR><DT><A NAME=22>22</a><DD>Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.<BR><DT><A NAME=23>23</a><DD>But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.<BR><DT><A NAME=24>24</a><DD>God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.<BR><DT><A NAME=25>25</a><DD>The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.<BR><DT><A NAME=26>26</a><DD>Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he.<BR><DT><A NAME=27>27</a><DD>And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?<BR><DT><A NAME=28>28</a><DD>The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,<BR><DT><A NAME=29>29</a><DD>Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?<BR><DT><A NAME=30>30</a><DD>Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.<BR><DT><A NAME=31>31</a><DD>In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.<BR><DT><A NAME=32>32</a><DD>But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of.<BR><DT><A NAME=33>33</a><DD>Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him ought to eat?<BR><DT><A NAME=34>34</a><DD>Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.<BR><DT><A NAME=35>35</a><DD>Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.<BR><DT><A NAME=36>36</a><DD>And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.<BR><DT><A NAME=37>37</a><DD>And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.<BR><DT><A NAME=38>38</a><DD>I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours.<BR><DT><A NAME=39>39</a><DD>And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did.<BR><DT><A NAME=40>40</a><DD>So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days.<BR><DT><A NAME=41>41</a><DD>And many more believed because of his own word;<BR><DT><A NAME=42>42</a><DD>And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.<BR><DT><A NAME=43>43</a><DD>Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.<BR><DT><A NAME=44>44</a><DD>For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country.<BR><DT><A NAME=45>45</a><DD>Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.<BR><DT><A NAME=46>46</a><DD>So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.<BR><DT><A NAME=47>47</a><DD>When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.<BR><DT><A NAME=48>48</a><DD>Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.<BR><DT><A NAME=49>49</a><DD>The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.<BR><DT><A NAME=50>50</a><DD>Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way.<BR><DT><A NAME=51>51</a><DD>And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him, saying, Thy son liveth.<BR><DT><A NAME=52>52</a><DD>Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.<BR><DT><A NAME=53>53</a><DD>So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house.<BR><DT><A NAME=54>54</a><DD>This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee.<BR></DL><CENTER><A HREF=43005.htm>John 5</A></CENTER><img src=i.gif width=2 height=500><br><center><a href=http://www.truth.info/download/bible.htm>Download Free Bible</a></center></BODY></HTML>
