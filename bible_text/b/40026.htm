And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver.<BR><DT><A NAME=16>16</a><DD>And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.<BR><DT><A NAME=17>17</a><DD>Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?<BR><DT><A NAME=18>18</a><DD>And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.<BR><DT><A NAME=19>19</a><DD>And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover.<BR><DT><A NAME=20>20</a><DD>Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.<BR><DT><A NAME=21>21</a><DD>And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.<BR><DT><A NAME=22>22</a><DD>And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?<BR><DT><A NAME=23>23</a><DD>And he answered and said, He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.<BR><DT><A NAME=24>24</a><DD>The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born.<BR><DT><A NAME=25>25</a><DD>Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, Thou hast said.<BR><DT><A NAME=26>26</a><DD>And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.<BR><DT><A NAME=27>27</a><DD>And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;<BR><DT><A NAME=28>28</a><DD>For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.<BR><DT><A NAME=29>29</a><DD>But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.<BR><DT><A NAME=30>30</a><DD>And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.<BR><DT><A NAME=31>31</a><DD>Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, <A HREF=38013.htm#7>I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.</A> Zech 13:7 <A HREF=41014.htm#27>Mark 14:27</A><BR><DT><A NAME=32>32</a><DD>But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.<BR><DT><A NAME=33>33</a><DD>Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended.<BR><DT><A NAME=34>34</a><DD>Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.<BR><DT><A NAME=35>35</a><DD>Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.<BR><DT><A NAME=36>36</a><DD>Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.<BR><DT><A NAME=37>37</a><DD>And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.<BR><DT><A NAME=38>38</a><DD>Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.<BR><DT><A NAME=39>39</a><DD>And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.<BR><DT><A NAME=40>40</a><DD>And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?<BR><DT><A NAME=41>41</a><DD>Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.<BR><DT><A NAME=42>42</a><DD>He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.<BR><DT><A NAME=43>43</a><DD>And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.<BR><DT><A NAME=44>44</a><DD>And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.<BR><DT><A NAME=45>45</a><DD>Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.<BR><DT><A NAME=46>46</a><DD>Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.<BR><DT><A NAME=47>47</a><DD>And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people.<BR><DT><A NAME=48>48</a><DD>Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.<BR><DT><A NAME=49>49</a><DD>And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him.<BR><DT><A NAME=50>50</a><DD>And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus and took him.<BR><DT><A NAME=51>51</a><DD>And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote off his ear.<BR><DT><A NAME=52>52</a><DD>Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.<BR><DT><A NAME=53>53</a><DD>Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?<BR><DT><A NAME=54>54</a><DD>But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?<BR><DT><A NAME=55>55</a><DD>In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.<BR><DT><A NAME=56>56</a><DD>But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.<BR><DT><A NAME=57>57</a><DD>And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.<BR><DT><A NAME=58>58</a><DD>But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest's palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.<BR><DT><A NAME=59>59</a><DD>Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;<BR><DT><A NAME=60>60</a><DD>But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,<BR><DT><A NAME=61>61</a><DD>And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.<BR><DT><A NAME=62>62</a><DD>And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?<BR><DT><A NAME=63>63</a><DD>But Jesus held his peace, And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.<BR><DT><A NAME=64>64</a><DD>Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see <A HREF=19110.htm#1>the Son of man sitting on the right hand</A> of power, and <A HREF=27007.htm#13>coming in the clouds of heaven.</A> Ps 110:1 Dan 7:13<BR><DT><A NAME=65>65</a><DD>Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy.<BR><DT><A NAME=66>66</a><DD>What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.<BR><DT><A NAME=67>67</a><DD>Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands,<BR><DT><A NAME=68>68</a><DD>Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?<BR><DT><A NAME=69>69</a><DD>Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.<BR><DT><A NAME=70>70</a><DD>But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.<BR><DT><A NAME=71>71</a><DD>And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth.<BR><DT><A NAME=72>72</a><DD>And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.<BR><DT><A NAME=73>73</a><DD>And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee.<BR><DT><A NAME=74>74</a><DD>Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew.<BR><DT><A NAME=75>75</a><DD>And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.<BR></DL><CENTER><A HREF=40027.htm>Matthew 27</A></CENTER><img src=i.gif width=2 height=500><br><center><a href=http://www.truth.info/download/bible.htm>Download Free Bible</a></center></BODY></HTML>
