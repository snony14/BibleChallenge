Verily that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel.<BR><DT><A NAME=19>19</a><DD>For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant unto all, that I might gain the more.<BR><DT><A NAME=20>20</a><DD>And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;<BR><DT><A NAME=21>21</a><DD>To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law.<BR><DT><A NAME=22>22</a><DD>To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some.<BR><DT><A NAME=23>23</a><DD>And this I do for the gospel's sake, that I might be partaker thereof with you.<BR><DT><A NAME=24>24</a><DD>Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize?
