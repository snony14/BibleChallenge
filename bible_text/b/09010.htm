Is Saul also among the prophets?<BR><DT><A NAME=12>12</a><DD>And one of the same place answered and said, But who is their father?

And the LORD answered, Behold he hath hid himself among the stuff.<BR><DT><A NAME=23>23</a><DD>And they ran and fetched him thence: and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward.<BR><DT><A NAME=24>24</a><DD>And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom the LORD hath chosen, that there is none like him among all the people? And all the people shouted, and said, God save the king.<BR><DT><A NAME=25>25</a><DD>Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before the LORD. And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house.<BR><DT><A NAME=26>26</a><DD>And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and there went with him a band of men, whose hearts God had touched.<BR><DT><A NAME=27>27</a><DD>But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us? And they despised him, and brought no presents.
