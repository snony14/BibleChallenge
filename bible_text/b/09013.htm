And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.<BR><DT><A NAME=4>4</a><DD>And all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines, and that Israel also was had in abomination with the Philistines. And the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal.<BR><DT><A NAME=5>5</a><DD>And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from Bethaven.<BR><DT><A NAME=6>6</a><DD>When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits.<BR><DT><A NAME=7>7</a><DD>And some of the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. As for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.<BR><DT><A NAME=8>8</a><DD>And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel had appointed: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.<BR><DT><A NAME=9>9</a><DD>And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace offerings. And he offered the burnt offering.<BR><DT><A NAME=10>10</a><DD>And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him.<BR><DT><A NAME=11>11</a><DD>And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that thou camest not within the days appointed, and that the Philistines gathered themselves together at Michmash;<BR><DT><A NAME=12>12</a><DD>Therefore said I, The Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication unto the LORD: I forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt offering.<BR><DT><A NAME=13>13</a><DD>And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God, which he commanded thee: for now would the LORD have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever.<BR><DT><A NAME=14>14</a><DD>But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the LORD hath sought him a man after his own heart, and the LORD hath commanded him to be captain over his people, because thou hast not kept that which the LORD commanded thee.<BR><DT><A NAME=15>15</a><DD>And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were present with him, about six hundred men.<BR><DT><A NAME=16>16</a><DD>And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.<BR><DT><A NAME=17>17</a><DD>And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned unto the way that leadeth to Ophrah, unto the land of Shual:<BR><DT><A NAME=18>18</a><DD>And another company turned the way to Bethhoron: and another company turned to the way of the border that looketh to the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.<BR><DT><A NAME=19>19</a><DD>Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears:<BR><DT><A NAME=20>20</a><DD>But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock.<BR><DT><A NAME=21>21</a><DD>Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads.<BR><DT><A NAME=22>22</a><DD>So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found.<BR><DT><A NAME=23>23</a><DD>And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash.<BR></DL><CENTER><A HREF=09014.htm>1 Samuel 14</A></CENTER><img src=i.gif width=2 height=500><br><center><a href=http://www.truth.info/download/bible.htm>Download Free Bible</a></center></BODY></HTML>
