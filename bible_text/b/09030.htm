And he said, I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days agone I fell sick.<BR><DT><A NAME=14>14</a><DD>We made an invasion upon the south of the Cherethites, and upon the coast which belongeth to Judah, and upon the south of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.<BR><DT><A NAME=15>15</a><DD>And David said to him, Canst thou bring me down to this company?
