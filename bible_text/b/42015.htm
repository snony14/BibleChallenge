And he divided unto them his living.<BR><DT><A NAME=13>13</a><DD>And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living.<BR><DT><A NAME=14>14</a><DD>And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want.<BR><DT><A NAME=15>15</a><DD>And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.<BR><DT><A NAME=16>16</a><DD>And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.<BR><DT><A NAME=17>17</a><DD>And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger!<BR><DT><A NAME=18>18</a><DD>I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee,<BR><DT><A NAME=19>19</a><DD>And am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.<BR><DT><A NAME=20>20</a><DD>And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.<BR><DT><A NAME=21>21</a><DD>And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son.<BR><DT><A NAME=22>22</a><DD>But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet:<BR><DT><A NAME=23>23</a><DD>And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be merry:<BR><DT><A NAME=24>24</a><DD>For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.<BR><DT><A NAME=25>25</a><DD>Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard musick and dancing.<BR><DT><A NAME=26>26</a><DD>And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant.<BR><DT><A NAME=27>27</a><DD>And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound.<BR><DT><A NAME=28>28</a><DD>And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his father out, and intreated him.<BR><DT><A NAME=29>29</a><DD>And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends:<BR><DT><A NAME=30>30</a><DD>But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.<BR><DT><A NAME=31>31</a><DD>And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine.<BR><DT><A NAME=32>32</a><DD>It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.<BR></DL><CENTER><A HREF=42016.htm>Luke 16</A></CENTER><img src=i.gif width=2 height=500><br><center><a href=http://www.truth.info/download/bible.htm>Download Free Bible</a></center></BODY></HTML>
