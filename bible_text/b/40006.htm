Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.<BR><DT><A NAME=3>3</a><DD>But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:<BR><DT><A NAME=4>4</a><DD>That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.<BR><DT><A NAME=5>5</a><DD>And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.<BR><DT><A NAME=6>6</a><DD>But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.<BR><DT><A NAME=7>7</a><DD>But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.<BR><DT><A NAME=8>8</a><DD>Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.<BR><DT><A NAME=9>9</a><DD>After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.<BR><DT><A NAME=10>10</a><DD>Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.<BR><DT><A NAME=11>11</a><DD>Give us this day our daily bread.<BR><DT><A NAME=12>12</a><DD>And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.<BR><DT><A NAME=13>13</a><DD>And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.<BR><DT><A NAME=14>14</a><DD>For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:<BR><DT><A NAME=15>15</a><DD>But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.<BR><DT><A NAME=16>16</a><DD>Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.<BR><DT><A NAME=17>17</a><DD>But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face;<BR><DT><A NAME=18>18</a><DD>That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.<BR><DT><A NAME=19>19</a><DD>Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:<BR><DT><A NAME=20>20</a><DD>But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:<BR><DT><A NAME=21>21</a><DD>For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.<BR><DT><A NAME=22>22</a><DD>The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.<BR><DT><A NAME=23>23</a><DD>But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!<BR><DT><A NAME=24>24</a><DD>No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.<BR><DT><A NAME=25>25</a><DD>Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?<BR><DT><A NAME=26>26</a><DD>Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?<BR><DT><A NAME=27>27</a><DD>Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?<BR><DT><A NAME=28>28</a><DD>And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:<BR><DT><A NAME=29>29</a><DD>And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.<BR><DT><A NAME=30>30</a><DD>Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?<BR><DT><A NAME=31>31</a><DD>Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?<BR><DT><A NAME=32>32</a><DD>(For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.<BR><DT><A NAME=33>33</a><DD>But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.<BR><DT><A NAME=34>34</a><DD>Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.<BR></DL><CENTER><A HREF=40007.htm>Matthew 7</A></CENTER><img src=i.gif width=2 height=500><br><center><a href=http://www.truth.info/download/bible.htm>Download Free Bible</a></center></BODY></HTML>
