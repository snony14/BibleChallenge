And she said, the daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bare unto him: and I put the earring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands.<BR><DT><A NAME=48>48</a><DD>And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed the LORD God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter unto his son.<BR><DT><A NAME=49>49</a><DD>And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.<BR><DT><A NAME=50>50</a><DD>Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from the LORD: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good.<BR><DT><A NAME=51>51</a><DD>Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be thy master's son's wife, as the LORD hath spoken.<BR><DT><A NAME=52>52</a><DD>And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard their words, he worshipped the LORD, bowing himself to the earth.<BR><DT><A NAME=53>53</a><DD>And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things.<BR><DT><A NAME=54>54</a><DD>And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my master.<BR><DT><A NAME=55>55</a><DD>And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go.<BR><DT><A NAME=56>56</a><DD>And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hath prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master.<BR><DT><A NAME=57>57</a><DD>And they said, We will call the damsel, and inquire at her mouth.<BR><DT><A NAME=58>58</a><DD>And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man?
