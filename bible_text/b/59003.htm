If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body.<BR><DT><A NAME=3>3</a><DD>Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body.<BR><DT><A NAME=4>4</a><DD>Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth.<BR><DT><A NAME=5>5</a><DD>Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!<BR><DT><A NAME=6>6</a><DD>And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.<BR><DT><A NAME=7>7</a><DD>For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind:<BR><DT><A NAME=8>8</a><DD>But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.<BR><DT><A NAME=9>9</a><DD>Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.<BR><DT><A NAME=10>10</a><DD>Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.<BR><DT><A NAME=11>11</a><DD>Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter?<BR><DT><A NAME=12>12</a><DD>Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.<BR><DT><A NAME=13>13</a><DD>Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.<BR><DT><A NAME=14>14</a><DD>But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.<BR><DT><A NAME=15>15</a><DD>This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.<BR><DT><A NAME=16>16</a><DD>For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work.<BR><DT><A NAME=17>17</a><DD>But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.<BR><DT><A NAME=18>18</a><DD>And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.<BR></DL><CENTER><A HREF=59004.htm>James 4</A></CENTER><img src=i.gif width=2 height=500><br><center><a href=http://www.truth.info/download/bible.htm>Download Free Bible</a></center></BODY></HTML>
