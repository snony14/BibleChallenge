and not to be set on a candlestick?<BR><DT><A NAME=22>22</a><DD>For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad.<BR><DT><A NAME=23>23</a><DD>If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.<BR><DT><A NAME=24>24</a><DD>And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you that hear shall more be given.<BR><DT><A NAME=25>25</a><DD>For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath.<BR><DT><A NAME=26>26</a><DD>And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground;<BR><DT><A NAME=27>27</a><DD>And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.<BR><DT><A NAME=28>28</a><DD>For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.<BR><DT><A NAME=29>29</a><DD>But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come.<BR><DT><A NAME=30>30</a><DD>And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it?<BR><DT><A NAME=31>31</a><DD>It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth:<BR><DT><A NAME=32>32</a><DD>But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.<BR><DT><A NAME=33>33</a><DD>And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear it.<BR><DT><A NAME=34>34</a><DD>But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.<BR><DT><A NAME=35>35</a><DD>And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, Let us pass over unto the other side.<BR><DT><A NAME=36>36</a><DD>And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships.<BR><DT><A NAME=37>37</a><DD>And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full.<BR><DT><A NAME=38>38</a><DD>And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish?<BR><DT><A NAME=39>39</a><DD>And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.<BR><DT><A NAME=40>40</a><DD>And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith?<BR><DT><A NAME=41>41</a><DD>And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?<BR></DL><CENTER><A HREF=41005.htm>Mark 5</A></CENTER><img src=i.gif width=2 height=500><br><center><a href=http://www.truth.info/download/bible.htm>Download Free Bible</a></center></BODY></HTML>
