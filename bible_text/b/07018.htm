Then said the priest unto them, What do ye?<BR><DT><A NAME=19>19</a><DD>And they said unto him, Hold thy peace, lay thine hand upon thy mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest: is it better for thee to be a priest unto the house of one man, or that thou be a priest unto a tribe and a family in Israel?<BR><DT><A NAME=20>20</a><DD>And the priest's heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst of the people.<BR><DT><A NAME=21>21</a><DD>So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the cattle and the carriage before them.<BR><DT><A NAME=22>22</a><DD>And when they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men that were in the houses near to Micah's house were gathered together, and overtook the children of Dan.<BR><DT><A NAME=23>23</a><DD>And they cried unto the children of Dan. And they turned their faces, and said unto Micah, What aileth thee, that thou comest with such a company?<BR><DT><A NAME=24>24</a><DD>And he said, Ye have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and ye are gone away: and what have I more? and what is this that ye say unto me, What aileth thee?<BR><DT><A NAME=25>25</a><DD>And the children of Dan said unto him, Let not thy voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows run upon thee, and thou lose thy life, with the lives of thy household.<BR><DT><A NAME=26>26</a><DD>And the children of Dan went their way: and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back unto his house.<BR><DT><A NAME=27>27</a><DD>And they took the things which Micah had made, and the priest which he had, and came unto Laish, unto a people that were at quiet and secure: and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and burnt the city with fire.<BR><DT><A NAME=28>28</a><DD>And there was no deliverer, because it was far from Zidon, and they had no business with any man; and it was in the valley that lieth by Bethrehob. And they built a city, and dwelt therein.<BR><DT><A NAME=29>29</a><DD>And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born unto Israel: howbeit the name of the city was Laish at the first.<BR><DT><A NAME=30>30</a><DD>And the children of Dan set up the graven image: and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land.<BR><DT><A NAME=31>31</a><DD>And they set them up Micah's graven image, which he made, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.<BR></DL><CENTER><A HREF=07019.htm>Judges 19</A></CENTER><img src=i.gif width=2 height=500><br><center><a href=http://www.truth.info/download/bible.htm>Download Free Bible</a></center></BODY></HTML>
