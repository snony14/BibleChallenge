I appeal unto Caesar.<BR><DT><A NAME=12>12</a><DD>Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Hast thou appealed unto Caesar? unto Caesar shalt thou go.<BR><DT><A NAME=13>13</a><DD>And after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto Caesarea to salute Festus.<BR><DT><A NAME=14>14</a><DD>And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul's cause unto the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix:<BR><DT><A NAME=15>15</a><DD>About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me, desiring to have judgment against him.<BR><DT><A NAME=16>16</a><DD>To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man to die, before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face, and have licence to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him.<BR><DT><A NAME=17>17</a><DD>Therefore, when they were come hither, without any delay on the morrow I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought forth.<BR><DT><A NAME=18>18</a><DD>Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none accusation of such things as I supposed:<BR><DT><A NAME=19>19</a><DD>But had certain questions against him of their own superstition, and of one Jesus, which was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.<BR><DT><A NAME=20>20</a><DD>And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked him whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these matters.<BR><DT><A NAME=21>21</a><DD>But when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to Caesar.<BR><DT><A NAME=22>22</a><DD>Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man myself.

Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, O king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I might have somewhat to write.<BR><DT><A NAME=27>27</a><DD>For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not withal to signify the crimes laid against him.<BR></DL><CENTER><A HREF=44026.htm>Acts 26</A></CENTER><img src=i.gif width=2 height=500><br><center><a href=http://www.truth.info/download/bible.htm>Download Free Bible</a></center></BODY></HTML>
