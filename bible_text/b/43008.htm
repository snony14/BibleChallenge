But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not. <BR><DT><A NAME=7>7</a><DD>So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.<BR><DT><A NAME=8>8</a><DD>And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.<BR><DT><A NAME=9>9</a><DD>And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.<BR><DT><A NAME=10>10</a><DD>When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?<BR><DT><A NAME=11>11</a><DD>She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.<BR><DT><A NAME=12>12</a><DD>Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.<BR><DT><A NAME=13>13</a><DD>The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true.<BR><DT><A NAME=14>14</a><DD>Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of myself, yet my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go.<BR><DT><A NAME=15>15</a><DD>Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.<BR><DT><A NAME=16>16</a><DD>And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.<BR><DT><A NAME=17>17</a><DD>It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true. <A HREF=05019.htm#15>Dt 19:15</A> <A HREF=40018.htm#16>Mt 18:16</A> <A HREF=47013.htm#1>2 Cor 13:1</A> <A HREF=54005.htm#19>1 Tim 5:19</A><BR><DT><A NAME=18>18</a><DD>I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.<BR><DT><A NAME=19>19</a><DD>Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also.<BR><DT><A NAME=20>20</a><DD>These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.<BR><DT><A NAME=21>21</a><DD>Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come.<BR><DT><A NAME=22>22</a><DD>Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come.<BR><DT><A NAME=23>23</a><DD>And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.<BR><DT><A NAME=24>24</a><DD>I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.<BR><DT><A NAME=25>25</a><DD>Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them, Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning.<BR><DT><A NAME=26>26</a><DD>I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.<BR><DT><A NAME=27>27</a><DD>They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.<BR><DT><A NAME=28>28</a><DD>Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.<BR><DT><A NAME=29>29</a><DD>And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.<BR><DT><A NAME=30>30</a><DD>As he spake these words, many believed on him.<BR><DT><A NAME=31>31</a><DD>Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed;<BR><DT><A NAME=32>32</a><DD>And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.<BR><DT><A NAME=33>33</a><DD>They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?<BR><DT><A NAME=34>34</a><DD>Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.<BR><DT><A NAME=35>35</a><DD>And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the Son abideth ever.<BR><DT><A NAME=36>36</a><DD>If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.<BR><DT><A NAME=37>37</a><DD>I know that ye are Abraham's seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.<BR><DT><A NAME=38>38</a><DD>I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.<BR><DT><A NAME=39>39</a><DD>They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham.<BR><DT><A NAME=40>40</a><DD>But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.<BR><DT><A NAME=41>41</a><DD>Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God.<BR><DT><A NAME=42>42</a><DD>Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.<BR><DT><A NAME=43>43</a><DD>Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word.<BR><DT><A NAME=44>44</a><DD>Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.<BR><DT><A NAME=45>45</a><DD>And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not.<BR><DT><A NAME=46>46</a><DD>Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me?<BR><DT><A NAME=47>47</a><DD>He that is of God heareth God's words: ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God.<BR><DT><A NAME=48>48</a><DD>Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?<BR><DT><A NAME=49>49</a><DD>Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me.<BR><DT><A NAME=50>50</a><DD>And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.<BR><DT><A NAME=51>51</a><DD>Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.<BR><DT><A NAME=52>52</a><DD>Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death.<BR><DT><A NAME=53>53</a><DD>Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?<BR><DT><A NAME=54>54</a><DD>Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God:<BR><DT><A NAME=55>55</a><DD>Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying.<BR><DT><A NAME=56>56</a><DD>Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad.<BR><DT><A NAME=57>57</a><DD>Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?<BR><DT><A NAME=58>58</a><DD>Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.<BR><DT><A NAME=59>59</a><DD>Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.<BR></DL><CENTER><A HREF=43009.htm>John 9</A></CENTER><img src=i.gif width=2 height=500><br><center><a href=http://www.truth.info/download/bible.htm>Download Free Bible</a></center></BODY></HTML>
