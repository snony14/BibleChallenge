Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.<BR><DT><A NAME=8>8</a><DD>But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead.<BR><DT><A NAME=9>9</a><DD>For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.<BR><DT><A NAME=10>10</a><DD>And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death.<BR><DT><A NAME=11>11</a><DD>For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.<BR><DT><A NAME=12>12</a><DD>Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.<BR><DT><A NAME=13>13</a><DD>Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.<BR><DT><A NAME=14>14</a><DD>For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.<BR><DT><A NAME=15>15</a><DD>For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.<BR><DT><A NAME=16>16</a><DD>If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good.<BR><DT><A NAME=17>17</a><DD>Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.<BR><DT><A NAME=18>18</a><DD>For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not.<BR><DT><A NAME=19>19</a><DD>For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.<BR><DT><A NAME=20>20</a><DD>Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.<BR><DT><A NAME=21>21</a><DD>I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.<BR><DT><A NAME=22>22</a><DD>For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:<BR><DT><A NAME=23>23</a><DD>But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.<BR><DT><A NAME=24>24</a><DD>O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?<BR><DT><A NAME=25>25</a><DD>I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.<BR></DL><CENTER><A HREF=45008.htm>Romans 8</A></CENTER><img src=i.gif width=2 height=500><br><center><a href=http://www.truth.info/download/bible.htm>Download Free Bible</a></center></BODY></HTML>
