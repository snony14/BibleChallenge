And Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.<BR><DT><A NAME=3>3</a><DD>And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause.<BR><DT><A NAME=4>4</a><DD>And Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life.<BR><DT><A NAME=5>5</a><DD>But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face.<BR><DT><A NAME=6>6</a><DD>And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand; but save his life.<BR><DT><A NAME=7>7</a><DD>So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.<BR><DT><A NAME=8>8</a><DD>And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat down among the ashes.<BR><DT><A NAME=9>9</a><DD>Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity? curse God, and die.<BR><DT><A NAME=10>10</a><DD>But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh.
