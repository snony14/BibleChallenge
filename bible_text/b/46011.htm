What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.<BR><DT><A NAME=23>23</a><DD>For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:<BR><DT><A NAME=24>24</a><DD>And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.<BR><DT><A NAME=25>25</a><DD>After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.<BR><DT><A NAME=26>26</a><DD>For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come.<BR><DT><A NAME=27>27</a><DD>Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.<BR><DT><A NAME=28>28</a><DD>But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup.<BR><DT><A NAME=29>29</a><DD>For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.<BR><DT><A NAME=30>30</a><DD>For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.<BR><DT><A NAME=31>31</a><DD>For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.<BR><DT><A NAME=32>32</a><DD>But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.<BR><DT><A NAME=33>33</a><DD>Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another.<BR><DT><A NAME=34>34</a><DD>And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.<BR></DL><CENTER><A HREF=46012.htm>1 Corinthians 12</A></CENTER><img src=i.gif width=2 height=500><br><center><a href=http://www.truth.info/download/bible.htm>Download Free Bible</a></center></BODY></HTML>
