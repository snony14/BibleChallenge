For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.", "6": "For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.", "7": "A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.", "8": "Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:", "9": "But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.", "10": "For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.", "11": "Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.", "12": "Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:", "13": "But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.", "14": "Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.", "15": "Do not err, my beloved brethren.", "16": "Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.", "17": "Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.", "18": "Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:", "19": "For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.", "20": "Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.", "21": "But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.", "22": "For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:", "23": "For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.", "24": "But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.", "25": "If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain.", "26": "Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world."}
