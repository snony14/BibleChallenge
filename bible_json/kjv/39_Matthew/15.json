Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition.", "6": "Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,", "7": "This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.", "8": "But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.", "9": "And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand:", "10": "Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.", "11": "Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?", "12": "But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.", "13": "Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.", "14": "Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable.", "15": "And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding?", "16": "Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?", "17": "But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man.", "18": "For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:", "19": "These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.", "20": "Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon.", "21": "And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.", "22": "But he answered her not a word.
